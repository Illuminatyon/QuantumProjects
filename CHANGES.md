# Changes Made to Fix Qiskit Import Issues

## Issue Description

The projects were encountering the following error when trying to run:

```
ImportError: cannot import name 'Aer' from 'qiskit' (C:\Users\fabio\AppData\Local\Packages\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.11_qbz5n2kfra8p0\LocalCache\local-packages\Python311\site-packages\qiskit\__init__.py)
```

This error occurred because in newer versions of Qiskit (0.39.0 and later), the `Aer` module has been moved to a separate package called `qiskit-aer`. Additionally, the `execute` function has been deprecated in favor of using the backend's `run` method directly.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Import Statements

In the following files:
- `quantum_simulator/quantum_engine.py`
- `entanglement_visualizer/quantum_generator.py`

Changed:
```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute, transpile
```

To:
```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile
from qiskit_aer import Aer
from qiskit_aer.backends.aer_simulator import AerSimulator
```

### 2. Updated Code to Use Backend's Run Method

In the same files, replaced calls to the `execute` function with direct calls to the backend's `run` method.

Changed:
```python
job = execute(circuit, backend)
```

To:
```python
transpiled_circuit = transpile(circuit, backend)
job = backend.run(transpiled_circuit)
```

### 3. Updated Requirements Files

In the following files:
- `quantum_simulator/requirements.txt`
- `entanglement_visualizer/requirements.txt`

Added:
```
qiskit-aer>=0.12.0
```

## How to Install the Updated Dependencies

Run the following command in each project directory:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install the required `qiskit-aer` package along with the other dependencies.

## Explanation

The Qiskit project has been modularized in recent versions, with different components moved to separate packages:

- `qiskit-terra` (core functionality, now just called `qiskit`)
- `qiskit-aer` (simulators)
- `qiskit-ibm-runtime` (IBM Quantum services)
- And others

This modularization allows for more focused development and smaller installation footprints, but it requires updating import statements and dependencies in existing code.

Additionally, the `execute` function has been deprecated in favor of using the backend's `run` method directly, which provides more consistent behavior across different backends.

These changes ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Qiskit while maintaining the same functionality in the quantum computing projects.
